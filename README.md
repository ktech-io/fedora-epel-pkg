## burp2 packaging status

At this time of writing (2016-05), burp 2.x is not available neither by EPEL yum channel nor Fedora project.  
Here the status of building this software against various distributions:

* el5, el6, el7 : building/packaging is fine
* fedora 22, 23, 24 and fedora-rawhide: building/packaging is fine
* XXX COPR building for arch ARM is unusable, too much wait (2016-02)

NB: elx = RHELx and derivatives  (CentOS x, ScientificLinux x, etc)


## burp 1.x packaging status

version: 1.4.40 (2016-03)

* EPEL channel provides binary package of burp 1.x for el6 and el7, but NOT for el5.
* FedoraProject provides burp 1.x packaging for Fedora 22, Fedora 23, and Fedora-rawhide

* el5 (RHEL5, CentOS 5):
    * not provided by EPEL repository for burp 1.x (as this time of writing)
    * build is fine with the .spec file provided by the 'el5' branch of this repo.
    * need yajl-devel package too, that has to be built to (branch 'el5').
    * does not need uthash package, since uthash provided in burp 1.x source code.
        (that is nice since uthash is not packaged for el5, either in OS, update or EPEL yum channels)


## howto use these source packaging

If you want to use this stuff to rebuild yourself your binary packages, here the instructions to achieve it.

* branch `el5` : source packaging for el5 (RHEL5, CentOS5, etc)
* branch `master` : source packaging for all other platforms than el5

Getting tired of `tito` stuff, uses a more conventional file structure:

```
<pkg>/SPECS/ ......... contains the Specfile of package <pkg>
<pkg>/SOURCES/ ....... contains all needed source files
```

Usage: 

* install the EPEL repo

* build a (binary) package:  
    ```
cd <pkg>
mkdir -p RPMS BUILD SRPMS
rpmbuild --define="_topdir $(pwd)" -bb SPECS/<pkg>.spec
    ```

* build a source package into `<pkg>/SPRMS/` folder:  
    ```
cd <pkg>
mkdir -p SRPMS
rpmbuild --define="_topdir $(pwd)" -bs SPECS/<pkg>.spec
    ```

To request a build with COPR infrastructure, choose to generate from a SRPM file that you upload.
